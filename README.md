# diskevolution
Evolution code for a viscously evolving gaseous disk.


Throughout our work, following the work of Guilera & SÃ¡ndor (2017), we used a full implicit Crank-Nicholson method to evolve the density profile of a 1D gaseous disk, solving the viscous evolution equation considering zero torques at the boundaries.
